# kaggle_housing_price_prediction
Repository for my personal project to housing price prediction using deep neural network

This ANN model has perceptron of multilayer fully connected and composed of 4-layer 
including 1-input, 3-hidden and 1-fully connected layer(Do not confuse it with 
the fully connected layer of DNN architecture, this is a layer combine all nodes)

For evaluation used 5-fold cross validation and used mse, mae, r2score validation metric
